# Organization-wide GitHub Configuration

The `.github` repository is given [special treatment](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile) by GitHub, allowing us to configure profile information for the organization. It also made sense as a place to put some common code shared across repos such as our SQL linting action which lives here and is referenced by other repositories; this ensures our code standards are enforced consistently.
